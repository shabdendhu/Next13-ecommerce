```
# Next.js README

This README provides guidance on setting up a Next.js project with necessary configurations and dependencies.

## Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

## Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies using npm or yarn:

```bash
cd <project_directory>
npm install
```
or
```bash
yarn install
```

## Install MongoDB Server

Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running locally. If not, you can download and install MongoDB from the [official website](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).

## Add Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add the following environment variables:

```
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=""
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=""
JWT_TOKEN_SECRET=""
MONGODB_URI=""
NEXTAUTH_URL=""
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=""
NEXT_BASE_URL=""
FILE_UPLOAD_LOCATION=""
NEXT_PUBLIC_MERCHANT_ID="PGTESTPAYUAT"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SALT_INDEX="1"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SALT_KEY="099eb0cd-02cf-4e2a-8aca-3e6c6aff0399"
```

Fill in the values for each variable according to your project requirements.

## Start the Server

To start the Next.js server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```
or
```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start the development server and your Next.js application will be accessible at the specified port (usually `http://localhost:3000`).

Make sure MongoDB is running in the background for your application to interact with the database.

That's it! You've successfully set up your Next.js project with the required configurations and dependencies. Happy coding! ðŸš€
